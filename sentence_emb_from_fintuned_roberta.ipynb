Using this method, we are able to provide for the first time neural\nnetwork mass estimation for the observed eFEDS cluster sample from Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma/eROSITA observations and we\nfind consistent performance with weak lensing calibrated masses. In this measurement, we do not use weak lensing information and\nwe only use previous cluster mass information which was used to calibrate the cluster properties in the simulations. When compared\nto simulated data, we observe a reduced scatter with respect to luminosity and count-rate based scaling relations.
